# Project Angular
This is my simple project made with Angular. The project was made for the course Angular SoftUni-2020.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.


## The project is very simple. It has two parts:

### No-authentication (Anonymous) part:
#### register - where you can register a user
#### login - login a register user
#### Home page - you can see all categories, their posts and details about them

### Authentication(User) part :
#### create category - can create category in blog 
#### create posts - can create posts for every different category 
#### my posts - can see which posts are yours
#### can delete your post if you want - this can happens in post detail 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Back-end is written with Express and Mongo DB for database

For start server you need to run `node index`.
