# ProjectAngular
This is my simple project made with Angular.
## The project is very simple. It has two parts:
=No-authentication part, which includes:
login, register and home page ,where you can see all categories, their posts and posts` details.

=Authentication(user) part is where you can:
create category, create posts, see which posts are yours and you could delete post if you want.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.
